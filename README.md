## ðŸš€ Backend Overview

This backend project is primarily mock-based and doesn't currently interact with a real database.

All the logic is located in a single file â€“ server.ts. The purpose of this setup is to quickly prototype and support the frontend development without introducing unnecessary complexity at this stage.

Of course, in a production-grade or large-scale project, I would split the codebase into proper architectural layers (e.g., resolvers, services, models, and database access) for maintainability and scalability.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

Built with Node.js, Express, GraphQL, and TypeScript.

Designed for simplicity and fast iteration.

You can run it locally and use it as a GraphQL mock server to test frontend features.

Let me know if you'd like to see an example of how I would structure this in a real-world project.
